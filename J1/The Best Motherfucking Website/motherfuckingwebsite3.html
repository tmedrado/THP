		<header><h1 id="toptext" style="margin-bottom: 40px;">This is the best motherfucking website.</h1></header>
		<aside>Really, it is.</aside>

		<h2>Seriously, you guys think that a fucking website doesn't need some styling?</h1>

		<p>You probably build websites using vim and feeling hardcore. You think your 4.99KB motherfuckingwebsite(.com) is going to get you some fucking award to put on your damn footer as a link. You think your fucking default font is gonna make your website run even on a toaster.</p>
		<p><span style='color: red;'>WRONG</span>, motherfucker.</p>

		<h2>The best kick-ass website</h2>
		<p>Let me describe the real perfect-ass website which still has the glory of the past motherfuckingwebsites:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Shit doesn't weigh a ton (in fact it's just 34.97 KB when the 27.83KB cat picture below is removed)</li>
			<li>The page weighs exactly 63.02kB, 93.7% less than the Google home page</li>
			<li>Fits on your iPhone 1st gen (although it doesn't work on your damn 16x32 Tamagotchi)</li>
			<li>Looks almost the same on every screen</li>
			<li>Every asshole that visits this website can use it without any problem </li>
			<li>It's accessible, so everyone can enjoy it</li>
			<li>Shit is even more legible than the fucking two previous versions - and it also has a cleanish style without looking like an ARPANET website</li>
			<li>Doesn't load massive images or scripts. We should all care about people who still use IPoAC</li>
			<li>Uses only free and open resources. Like this ass-breaking font called "Open Sans"</li>
			<li>It doesn't load your glorious jQuery or jQueryUI with all their fucking styles and shits. Nor Angular or any other framework. This website is made with plain HTML, CSS3 and JS. Keep it Vanilla!
Doesn't include any tracking service</li>
			<li>Images aren't forbidden, but when SVG is available JUST USE IT.</li>
			<li>Use some fucking colors.</li>
			<li>Links don't really need to keep that shitty blue the browser is giving them: nor that violetish color when they are marked as visited. Just give them a nice color</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Well guess what, motherfucker:</h2>
		<p>This website is even better than the last guy and the guy before him.</p>
		<p>Why?</p>

		<ul>
			<li>Lots of itens below.....</li>
			<li>Still...</li>

		</ul>

		<h2>Put even less contrast</h2>
		<p>Yeah, a #444 is cool but a #454545 is better.</p>

		<p>We don't need to break our eyes while looking at a motherfuckingwebsite.</p>

		<h2>Size matters, yeah, but don't exaggerate</h2>
		<p>Remember, not everybody is blind, and not everybody wants to read a fucking 2 inches letter on a 27 inches screen, so keep it cool. Don't exaggerate in size, but don't make an ant-compatible text either.</p>

		<h2 style="margin-bottom: 40px;">Put some pictures</h2>

		<p>
		<img src="https://thebestmotherfucking.website/static/e84d13374f0772372eaa86614800bd58.jpg" alt="Little cat" style="float:left;width:300px;height:300px; margin-right: 50px;">
		We're not looking at a novel by Stephanie Meyer, this is a motherfuckingwebsite so include some pictures to give a context.  </p>
		<p>The website shouldn't be overfilled with pictures, but it should make the user happy while reading your nonsense words.</p>

		<p id="cattext">You see that fancy cat? He's happy, you should be too.</p>
		



		<h2>Yes, even this is satire.</h2>
		<p>But this doesn't mean you should load your motherfuckingwebsite with shitty animations, instead keep it simple, minify its resources and use images responsibly. Remember the IPoAC users!</p>

		<hr>

		<h2>Epilogue</h2>
		<p>Actually this website was made to follow the trend of the motherfuckingwebsite and the bettermotherfuckingwebsite.</p>
		<p>Despite what was said here they're beautiful and truly among the best websites on the internet (even though this is still thebestmotherfuckingwebsite), so go check 'em out.</p>
		<p>Seriously, follow some of the advice we gave you, they'll "make the web great again"</p>
